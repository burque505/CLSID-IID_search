# CLSID-IID_search
An AutoHotkey script to search and filter CLSIDs and IIDs.

Type in some or all of a CLSID or IID to find.
You can delete, edit, and otherwise modify your search,
and the ListView will refresh accordingly.

When you see an ID you want to retrieve:

Double-right-click to get the name on the clipboard;
Double-click to get the value on the clipboard.

That's it!
